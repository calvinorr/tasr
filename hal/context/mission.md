# Mission - HAL Ecosystem

## Product Vision

A Claude Code skill ecosystem for managing development sessions, tracking progress, preventing scope creep, and maintaining project context across conversations.

## Goals

1. **Primary**: Provide structured session management for Claude Code
2. **Secondary**: Prevent scope drift with guardrails and context files
3. **Tertiary**: Enable seamless handoff between sessions via markdown state

## User Personas

### Solo Developer (Primary)
- Works on side projects with Claude Code
- Tends to get distracted by "nice to have" features
- Needs external structure to stay focused
- Values progress that persists across sessions

### Team Lead
- Manages multiple tracks simultaneously
- Needs visibility into AI-assisted development progress
- Values documentation and audit trails

## Elevator Pitch

"HAL keeps you on track during development sessions by managing context, preventing scope creep, and ensuring progress is saved across Claude Code sessions."

## Success Metrics

- Sessions end with saved state (no lost progress)
- Scope drift detected and redirected
- Tasks completed and logged with commit hashes
- Easy installation via copy commands
