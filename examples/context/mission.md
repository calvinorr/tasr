# Mission - Example Project

## Product Vision

A task tracking application that helps developers maintain focus during coding sessions.

## Goals

1. **Primary**: Prevent scope creep during development
2. **Secondary**: Track progress across sessions
3. **Tertiary**: Integrate with git workflow

## User Personas

### Solo Developer
- Works on side projects
- Tends to get distracted by "nice to have" features
- Needs external structure to stay focused

### Team Lead
- Manages multiple tracks simultaneously
- Needs visibility into progress
- Values documentation

## Elevator Pitch

"TARS keeps you on track during development sessions by managing context, preventing scope creep, and ensuring progress is saved across Claude Code sessions."

## Success Metrics

- Sessions end with saved state (no lost progress)
- Scope drift detected and redirected
- Tasks completed and logged with commit hashes
